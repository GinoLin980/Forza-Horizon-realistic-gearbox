# Realistic Gearbox for Forza Horizon 4/5 with Machine Learning

## Introduction
This is a branch of Realistic Gearbox for Forza Horizon, and focus on development of implementing machine learning for general compatibility and more life-like shifting.

## Features
- **Shift like a REAL CAR**: Experience gear shifting just like you would in a real vehicle.
- **General Compatibility**: Compatible with petrol, diesel, high rpm, low rpm cars.

## Installation     [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/GinoLin980/Forza-Horizon-realistic-gearbox/total.svg)]()
### [Release Page](https://github.com/GinoLin980/Forza-Horizon-realistic-gearbox/releases)

### Big thanks to this bros, I can't make this without them. ðŸ«¶

## Develop Progress
- 2024/4/19 - created `data_record.py` for recording data, and created ML model.
- 2024/4/20 - created `FH_auto_ML.py` for implementing the model prediction to real action.
- 2024/4/22 - fixed mathmetical problem of model's prediction. the model can train and predict correctly

## Future Goals
- [ ] Data preparation.

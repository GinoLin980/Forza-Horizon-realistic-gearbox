# Realistic Gearbox for Forza Horizon 4/5

## Introduction
This Python script enhances your driving experience in Forza Horizon 4/5 by simulating a realistic gearbox. It's perfect for those who enjoy casual driving in the city and occasional quick accelerations for overtaking. Inspired by [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_d0utwbM1M&ab_channel=TitouanDupuy) on a realistic gearbox, this project aims to bring that experience to everyone.

## Demonstration
Check out the [Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/d2Cw0pS0UbA) to see the gearbox in action!

## Features
- **Shift like a REAL CAR**: Experience gear shifting just like you would in a real vehicle.
- **Drive Mode Selection**: Choose between Normal, Sports, Eco, or Manual modes.

- **Advanced Users**: Download the `.py` file and feel free to tweak the values in your editor.

## Setup Instructions
- **Requirements**: **A controller or wheel is necessary.**
- **Open Game**: Open up Forza Horizon 4/5

## Future Goals
- [x] When coasting in high rpm and then full accelerate, it will sometimes upshift first and then downshift(maybe because the code detects too quickly)
- [x] Parameter fine tune(gas_threshold)

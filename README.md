# Realistic Gearbox for Forza Horizon 4/5

This project is a Python script for creating a realistic gearbox for Forza Horizon 4/5.
This project is inspired by a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_d0utwbM1M&ab_channel=TitouanDupuy) about a realistic gearbox, but that project was set to private. Therefore, this project was created.
